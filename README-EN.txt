Description
----------------------------------------------------

This module creates agreements and revocation 
information. The customer has to confirm both
agreements to be able to order in a German webshop.

Symmetrics_Agreement also enables the use of agreement
texts in Magento configuration. 

A German webshop uses agreement texts more than once.
For example in the email templates. So as the second
feature of this module we have rendering of the agreement 
window at the end of the order process. Using this module 
you can use {{blocks}} in agreement texts and call a 
static block from CMS. This blocks can be created with 
Symmetrics_ConfigGermanTexts or manually.
