* DOCUMENTATION

** INSTALLATION 
Extract content of this archive in your Magento directory. 
It might be necessary to clear/ refresh the Magento cache.

** USAGE 
The module creates order conditions (Terms and Conditions and 
Revocation Policy), which must be accepted by customers at the end of the ordering process. Besides, the module provides a possibility in the field in which in checkout the texts are displayed, to use block calls as  {{block type ...}}. Blocks themselves are not created by the module. They should be created either manually via CMS static blocks or with the help of module Symmetrics_ConfigGermanTexts. Blocks (identifier) should be called 
"mrg_business_terms" and "mrg_revocation". 

Symmetrics_Agreement also creates CMS pages Terms and Conditions, and 
Revocation Policy which are filled either with texts using Symmetrics_ConfigGermanTexts or manually. 

** FUNCTIONALITY
*** A: Activates the agreements in the system configuration
        under " System-> Configuration-> Sales-> To checkout
-> Payment options-> Enable Terms and Conditions "
*** B: Creates pages Terms and Conditions and Revocation Policy
*** C: Creates blocks "mrg_business_terms" and
        "mrg_revocation"
*** D: Inserts rendering for the field "Order conditions" in
        checkout, so that calls as {{block .}} could be used there
        The order conditions are found in backend under
        Sales / Order conditions.
*** E: Binds under b) created blocks to the agreeements
        

** TECHNICAL 
Overwrites the block Mage_Checkout_Model_Agreement and applies 
the standard template filter to the contents of the agreements. 
Pages, blocks and agreements are created via migration script.


* TESTCASES
** BASIC
*** A: Check whether the option is active under "System-> Configuration-> 
        Sales-> To checkout -> Payment options -> Enable Terms and 
        Conditions " and the corresponding blocks are displayed in Checkout review (the last step).   
*** B: Check whether these pages exist in frontend and backend.
*** C: Check whether these blocks exist in frontend and backend.
*** D: Try different calls in the agreements and check,
        whether these appear so in the Checkout / Review step.
        Examples:
        {{block type = "cms/block" block_id = "cms_block_name"}}
        Where cms_block_name should correspond to an available CMS Block Identifier.
        
*** E: 1. The migration script should provide agreements with the following contents:
           {{block type = "cms/block" block_id = "mrg_revocation"}} for the
           Revocation Policy and
           {{block type = "cms/block" block_id = "mrg_business_terms"}} for the
           Terms and Conditions.
       2. Check in the backend, whether these contents are found in the agreements.
       3. Check in the frontend in Checkout / Review step, whether these blocks
           really correspond to that, which is entered in the backend under CMS/blocks for the blocks mrg_revocation or mrg_business_terms.
